# pygmaeus_karyotype
R cripts were developed and used for the paper Bergelova et al (submitted), entitled 'Genomic rearrangements and jumping NORs in African clawed frogs (Xenopus: Pipidae) revealed by FISH mapping'

Statistics of pygmaeus karyotype is based on length of chromosomal arms. Measured values were added to Google sheets (line number, chromosome, p, q, relative length, p/q arm ratio). Values in each Google Sheets table were ordered increasingly based on chromosome length (Data -> Sort range -> Advanced range sorting options -> Sort by Column E, A to Z)

Each table of measurements was downloaded as Tab Separated Values (.tsv) to the 'chromosome_measurement' directory.
