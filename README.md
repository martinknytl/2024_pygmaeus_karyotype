# pygmaeus_karyotype
All scripts for the paper Bergelova et al XXX

statistics of pygmaeus karyotype besed on length of chromosomal arms

Google sheets with measured values were copied and in the copied Google sheet, 6 columns were left (line number, p, q, relative length, p/q arm ratio, chromosome)

Each table was ordered increasingly based on chromosome (Data -> Sort range -> Advanced range sorting options -> Sort by Column F, A to Z)

Each table of measurements was downloaded as Tab Separated Values (.tsv) under the name 'pygmaeus_chr_length_metafasename.tsv'
